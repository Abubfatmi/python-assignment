### How it works
```sh
This facial recognition program uses multiple library and modules, unlike our usual OpenCV and Tensorflow/Pytorch model we are using a pre exisitng solution i.e. 
```
[face_recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) 
```
which recognizes and manipulates faces from Python or from the command line with the world's simplest face recognition library.
```
#### Homepage

   The homepage of the GUI, click the "Recognize" button to start recognizing 
   Press the "Bored?" button to play the game.
